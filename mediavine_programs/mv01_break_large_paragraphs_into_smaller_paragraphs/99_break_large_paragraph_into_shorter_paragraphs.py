# Your large paragraph
large_paragraph = """Chocolate Covered Kiwi, also known as Kiwi dipped in chocolate or Chocolate Dipped Kiwi, is a gratifying confection that effortlessly marries the goodness of fresh kiwifruit with the satisfaction of premium chocolate. This exquisite dessert has a stunning blend of flavors and textures. Summers are all about meeting friends and having get-togethers. But sometimes we all have guests who donâ€™t drink any alcoholic beverages. Last week some of our friends joined us for dinner. Dinner parties usually start at 5.00 pm at my place. I know, I know, itâ€™s too early for a dinner party. But we all chit-chat before dinner and have some good time. So even 5:00 pm feels late in that context! Agree? ğŸ™‚"""
