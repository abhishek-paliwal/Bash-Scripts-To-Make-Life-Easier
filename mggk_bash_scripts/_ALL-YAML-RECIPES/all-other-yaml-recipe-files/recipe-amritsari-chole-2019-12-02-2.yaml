recipeNotes: "1. I have used dried chickpeas for this recipe because Amritsari chole taste best when cooked with dried chickpeas. But you can also make it using canned chickpeas. If using canned chickpeas, follow the same recipe of making onion tomato masala. Replace boiled chickpeas with canned chickpeas. Also, brew tea bags and add the tea mixture instead of water. Cover and cook until the chickpeas are soft and tender.<br>2. I have prepared Amritsari Chole in vegetable cooking oil, but they also taste great when cooked entirely in ghee or butter. You can either use butter or ghee for frying masala or use the combination of ghee and oil."
