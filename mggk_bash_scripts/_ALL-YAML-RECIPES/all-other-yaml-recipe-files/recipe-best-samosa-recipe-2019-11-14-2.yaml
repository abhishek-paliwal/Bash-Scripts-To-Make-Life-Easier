recipeNotes: "1. If you want a crispy outer layer, then I would recommend using ghee in the pastry dough. It helps in making the Samosa crispy.<br>2. Always fry samosa on low heat, to ensure that they are thoroughly cooked.<br>3. For stuffing, you can reduce the amount of red chili powder, and green chilies."
