recipeNotes: "1. Use the coarse variety of besan if possible. If you don't find coarse besan then you can also add 1 tablespoon of semolina to it.<br>2. Right consistency of batter plays an important role in making perfect boondi. Make sure the batter is neither too thick nor too thin.<br>3. After pouring batter, keep tapping your strainer or skimmer consistently.<br>4. Frying the boondis for 1 minute and take it out instantly.<br>5. Always make sure that you drain fried boondis on a lined paper to take out to get rid of excess oil/ghee.<br>6. If you want the market style sweet and melt in mouth ladoos, then resting boondi ladoos for 3-4 hours or more is important. Because this resting time makes sure that all the flavours in ladoos mingle so beautifully, and the boondis turn super soft.<br>6. You can store motichoor ladoo for up to 10 days when kept in an air-tight container."
