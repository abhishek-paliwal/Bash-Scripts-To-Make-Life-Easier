recipeNotes: "1. I generally roast suji without any fat (ghee/ oil). If you want you can roast suji in 1 tablespoon of ghee or oil.<br>2. If you are making the vegan version of this upma then simply omit the ghee or add vegan butter.<br>3. I have used 2 tablespoons oil for tempering, because it makes upma tasty and also the fat prevents upma from becoming sticky. However, you can always adjust the amount of ghee or oil for this upma recipe."
