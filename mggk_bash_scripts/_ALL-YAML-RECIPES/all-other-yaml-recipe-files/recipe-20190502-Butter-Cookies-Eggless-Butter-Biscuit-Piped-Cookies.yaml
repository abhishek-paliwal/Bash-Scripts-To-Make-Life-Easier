recipeNotes: "For piping, you can either use a cookie press or a piping bag with the nozzle of your choice.<br>If your cookies spread while baking, then you can chill the piped cookies in a freezer for 20-30 minutes. This step would ensure that your cookies retain the shape while baking.<br>You can also use salted baking margarine instead of butter."
