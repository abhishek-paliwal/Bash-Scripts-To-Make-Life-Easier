recipeNotes: "1. Pulsing dal is completely optional, you can skip this step.<br>2. The crust for khasta kachori is always made using maida. But if you want to healthify the recipe, then you can replace it with wheat flour or you can also use the combination of whole wheat flour and maida.<br>3. Before kneading the dough, check if you have added enough ‘moyan’ to flour. To check, grab a small amount of flour mixed with ghee and make a fist. If it holds the shape then you have added enough fat. If the dough falls to pieces, that means you need to add more oil/ghee."
