recipeNotes: "I have used white button mushrooms for this recipe, but you can also brown button mushrooms for this recipe. You can swap cream with cashew cream.<br>Never soak the mushrooms in the water, because they soak up the water and mushrooms won't turn nicely brown when cooked if they are full of water.<br>If you want mushroom gravy thick and creamy, then replace water with coconut milk. This would add extra richness."
