recipeNotes: "1. Add 1-2 tablespoons of water to sugar syrup every time you are heating it up. This way, the syrup will maintain it's sticky uniformity and won't get thicker.<br>2. Make sure the oil is hot enough before you drop the batter. To gauging the temperature for frying, simply drop a tiny piece of batter, If it sizzles and comes up without browning then the oil is perfect for frying jalebi. Or just use a wooden spoon, if you see bubbles around the wood then the oil is ready. If it sinks in the bottom then the oil is too cold, your jalebi won't turn crispy and they will absorb so much of oil/ghee. If the batter turns brown and comes right away on the top, then the batter is too hot, you jalebi would darken very fast from outside.<br>3. Always fry jalebi on medium heat. If your jalebi has shrunk, then that means you over-fried your jalebi. If your jalebi turns flat, then it means that jalebis were fried on low heat or the batter was too thin. If your jalebi comes out thick & soft, then the reason is that the batter is too thick."
