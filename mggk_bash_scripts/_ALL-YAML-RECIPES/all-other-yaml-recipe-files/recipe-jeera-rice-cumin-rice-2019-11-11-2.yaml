recipeNotes: "1. Jeera rice has a unique taste. I have added 1 tablespoon cumin seeds for 1 cup rice. But if you never had cumin seeds and are new to this taste, then you can start with 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and then increase the amount if you like the flavor.<br>2. I like my jeera rice plain without any chilies or onions, but if you like you can also add some onions and green chilies to jeera rice, to amp up the flavors."
