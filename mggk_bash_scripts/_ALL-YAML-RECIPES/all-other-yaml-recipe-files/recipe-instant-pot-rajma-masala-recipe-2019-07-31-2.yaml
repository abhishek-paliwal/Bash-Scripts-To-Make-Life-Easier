description: "Rajma or Razma Masala, is a popular vegetarian curry originating from North India. This North Indian melt-in-your-mouth kidney Bean Curry is made with rajma. In this curry, red kidney beans are soaked overnight, cooked in a spicy and thick onion tomato gravy consisting whole and powdered spices. For this Instant Pot Rajma Masala recipe, I cooked my rajma masala on high pressure for 35 minutes. But you can also make the Rajma masala using “Bean/Chili” mode."
