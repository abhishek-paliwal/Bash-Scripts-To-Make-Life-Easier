recipeNotes: "1. If rice flour is not easily available in your region then you can make your rice flour by grinding rice into a fine powder. You can also replace rice flour with cornflour to the batter.<br>2. Always make sure you fry the corn pakoda on medium heat. This would ensure that your pakoras would come out perfectly crispy. If the heat is too high, then pakoras would cook faster from outside, and won't cook from the center.<br>3. I like to add some freshly squeezed lemon juice for a slight tang in pakoras. If you want, you can either skip it or replace it with some amchur powder."
