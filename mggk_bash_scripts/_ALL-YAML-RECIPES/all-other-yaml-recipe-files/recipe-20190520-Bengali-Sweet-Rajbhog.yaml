recipeNotes: "Rajbhog stays fresh for upto 1 week when kept covered in the refrigerator.<br>I have added arrowroot to give slight stiffness to Rajbhog, but if you don’t find arrowroot you can simply replace it with semolina or corn starch. Arrowroot and semolina work as a binding agent and it is easier to shape them into balls after stuffing."
