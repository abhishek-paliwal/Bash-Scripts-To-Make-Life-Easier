recipeNotes: "1. You can also add fruits and vegetables of your choice and make this fruity veggie version of Boondi Raita.<br>2. If you want a mild version of boondi raita, then you can make a simple boondi raita by only adding only salt and cumin powder. Omit all the other spices.<br>3. If using salted boondi, add less salt, because the boondi also has salt in it.<br>4. It tastes best when served fresh, so serve this Boondi Raita immediately, or you can also refrigerate it for up to 1 day.<br>5. I did not add any green chilies in this raita. But if you want it hotter, then feel free to add some chopped green chilies. If you are using green chilies, then I would advise you to skip the red chili powder, or else it would be very hot."
