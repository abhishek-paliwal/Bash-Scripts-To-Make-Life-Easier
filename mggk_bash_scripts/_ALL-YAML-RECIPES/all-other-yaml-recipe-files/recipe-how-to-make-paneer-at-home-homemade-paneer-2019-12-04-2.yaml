recipeNotes: "1. Soak paneer in water, cover it and keep it in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Or you can freeze paneer up to 2 months.<br>2. Milk will not curdle properly if the acidic agent is not sufficient. In that case, instantly add little more yogurt/lemon juice/vinegar. Do not add too much acidic agent, use just as needed. <br>3. Do not overcook the paneer after curdling, or it may turn hard."
