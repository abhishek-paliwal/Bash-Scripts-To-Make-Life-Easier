recipeNotes: "1. For storing, transfer them into an air-tight container and store these kaju pista rolls for up to 15 to 20 days in the refrigerator.<br>2. You need to make a fine powder of cashews, but do not powder cashews too much, or else they will turn into a paste. So keep a close eye when grinding cashews.<br>3. Pass the cashew powder through a sieve to make sure that there are no big pieces in the cashew powder. Straining the powder would make the powder-fine and your rolls would turn out smoother."
