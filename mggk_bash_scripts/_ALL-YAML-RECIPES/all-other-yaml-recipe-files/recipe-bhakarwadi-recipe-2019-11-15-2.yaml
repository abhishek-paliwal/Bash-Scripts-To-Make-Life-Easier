recipeNotes: "1. If you don’t want to add garam masala powder, then you can also add a ¼ teaspoon of cinnamon (dalchini) and ¼ teaspoon of clove (laung) powder to the masala.<br>2. Some people like to add some sev (fried gram flour noodles or vermicelli) to bhakarwadi masala for an additional crunch. If you like you can also add some sev either in the masalas while grinding or sprinkle it over masala powder before rolling and folding bhakarwadis.<br>3. If you want to make them spicier, then add green chopped green chilies while roasting dry masalas.<br>4. You can store bhakarwadis in an airtight container lined with a Kitchen tissue. These stay fresh for up to 2-3 weeks."
