recipeNotes: "1. We need solid paneer cubes for making tikkas, so always use the firm paneer, which is not crumbly.<br>2. You can swap Kashmiri chili Powder with paprika.<br>3. You can substitute hung curd with full cream Turkish yogurt or Greek yogurt.<br>4. Always soak wooden skewers in water for at least 2 hours prior to use."
