recipeNotes: "1. For making besan churma, we need coarse (thick or mota) besan flour. If you can’t find coarse variety of  gram flour, then add some semolina to the besan like I did. This would give you the same results.<br>2. You can also knead the dough with milk instead of water to make your churma taste even more exotic.<br>3. If you think the churma (mixture) is too dry and it is hard to mould laddu, then you can add some warm milk to the mixture."
