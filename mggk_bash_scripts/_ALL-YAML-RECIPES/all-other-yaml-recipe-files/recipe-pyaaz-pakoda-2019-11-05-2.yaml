recipeNotes: "1. The temperature of oil has to be hot enough for frying pakoras. So before dropping the batter make sure that oil is moderately hot. If the oil is not hot enough, the pakoras will soak up oil. If the oil is too hot, the onion pakoda will brown outside but will not get cooked inside.<br>2. If you want a lighter and softer texture of onion pakoda then you can add 1-2 tablespoons of hot oil to the batter.<br>3. I did not add any herbs to my pakoras. If you want to give a leafy green touch to your onion pakodas, then you can also add some chopped coriander, or chopped mint leaves to the batter. Chopped spinach also tastes great in this recipe."
