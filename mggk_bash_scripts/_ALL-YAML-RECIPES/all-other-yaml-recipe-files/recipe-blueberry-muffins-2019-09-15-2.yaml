recipeNotes: "1. If you are making 8 muffins, then fill the remaining cups with 2 tablespoons of water. This will help the muffins bake evenly.<br>2. If you are using frozen blueberries, then use them frozen. Do not thaw them.<br>3. I have added sunflower oil for this recipe because I love the light texture of muffins made with oil. You can substitute oil with melted butter for a rich taste.<br>4. I have topped my muffins with pearl sugar because they are just so perfect for decorating and they taste so deliciously coarse and crunchy on top of a muffin. However, you can replace it with any other type of granulated or raw sugar of your choice."
