recipeNotes: "1. Traditional ladoo is made with tagar/boora sugar (made with sugar syrup), but finding boora everywhere is not so easy. So simply replace the boora with store-bought powdered sugar.<br>2. Remember to roast besan flour at low heat and keep stirring continuously. This is very important because if you stop stirring besan, then there are chances that besan might get burnt from the bottom.<br>3. I added sliced almonds to my ladoos. You can add any other chopped nuts or you can simply omit to add any nuts to besan ladoo recipe.<br>4. I personally donâ€™t like raisins in my besan ladoo, but if you like you can also add some raisins to the besan mixture along with sugar.<br>5. Halwai (Confectioner) style ladoos sometimes have muskmelon seeds, so if you like, you can also add some toasted muskmelon seeds (kharbuje ke beej) to it.<br>5. If the roasted ladoo mixture looks too dry, then add 1 tablespoon of melted ghee to it.<br>6. If the roasted ladoo mixture looks too wet, then keep it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes. The mixture would harden and you would be able to roll ladoos."
