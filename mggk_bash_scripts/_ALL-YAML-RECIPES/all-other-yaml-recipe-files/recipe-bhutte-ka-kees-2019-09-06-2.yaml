recipeNotes: "1. Sugar is optional in this recipe. If you want it 'Khatta Meetha' (tangy and sweet), like an Indori, then add it.<br>2. For the recipe, always use corn on the cob which have milkier and plump kernels.<br>3. This dish requires some extra oil, because Bhutte Ka Kees tastes great when it is cooked in ample amount oil/ghee. However, if you are not comfortable with 4 tablespoons of oil, then you can surely reduce the amount of oil/ghee."
