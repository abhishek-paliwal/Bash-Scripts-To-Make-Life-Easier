name: "Caramelized Peach Pesto Tart with Blueberries and Pistachio"

description: "These Caramelized Peach Pesto Tart with Blueberries and Pistachio are so full of caramelized peaches, pesto, feta cheese and some more feta cheese with fresh blueberries and pistachio. For a finishing touch they are nicely drizzled up with some sriracha sauce or some hot pepper sauce. The result you get is the perfect tarts — the most divine appetizers ever. These ingredients really go incredibly well together."
