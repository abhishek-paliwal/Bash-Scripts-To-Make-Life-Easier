description: "Honeydew Melon Radish Salad Bowl is an easy, fast, fresh, healthy and delish salad. The Dressing is slightly sweet, a little bit spicy and perfectly tangy. It really goes very well with the flavors and textures of this salad. The dressing adds just the right touch to the salad without overpowering the natural sweetness of the fruit. I have added some honey to the dressing for sweetness and to help bring out the juices in the fruit. This is VEGAN DAIRY_FREE and GLUTEN-FREE too."
