name: "Creamy Fruit and Nut Couscous Paneer Pudding with Chocolate"

description: "Creamy Fruit and Nut Couscous Paneer Pudding with Chocolate is rich, creamy with a classic texture. This pudding has some similarity to Indian rice pudding, aka ‘Kheer’, but this recipe is with some new ingredients. It is perfectly sweet, and very delicately flavored with cardamom, saffron and rosewater. And at the end, it is finally topped with coconut shavings, raisins, almonds, cardamom, chopped mangoes, grapes and dark chocolate. This is what I call a feeling of true heaven in a glass."
