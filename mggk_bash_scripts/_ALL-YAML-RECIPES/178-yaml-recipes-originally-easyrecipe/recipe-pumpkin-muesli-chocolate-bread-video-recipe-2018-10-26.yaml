description: "This Pumpkin Muesli Chocolate Bread has brown sugar, pumpkin, muesli, and chocolate. It is swirled with a layer of chocolate and a layer of muesli and some sprinkle of brown sugar. I did not drizzle it with any sauce. If you like sweet stuff then feel free to drizzle it with chocolate ganache. Also, if you like melting gooey chocolate in your bread, then eat it warm. Or if you think it’s too messy, then let it cool completely."
