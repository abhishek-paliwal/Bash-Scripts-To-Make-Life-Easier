description: "Quick And Easy Pineapple Kiwi Honey Yogurt Parfait is a light fruity and delicious parfait with kiwi, pineapple, yogurt, honey and cookies. It tastes best with fresh fruits, but you can also use canned pineapples. And if you want to have these for desserts too, then you have plenty of time for chilling. So just chill it for about 1-2 hours, and you are good to go."
