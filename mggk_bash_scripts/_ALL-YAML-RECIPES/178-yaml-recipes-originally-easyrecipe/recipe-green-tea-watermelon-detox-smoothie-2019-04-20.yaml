description: "Green Tea Watermelon Detox Smoothie Recipe — For this smoothie, I used a combo of green tea, watermelon, lemon, and honey. This smoothie is beyond YUM. This smoothie is dairy-free, gluten-free, and sugar-free too if you skip honey! Add maple syrup to make it VEGAN. This mighty super vibrant red smoothie tastes AWESOME."
