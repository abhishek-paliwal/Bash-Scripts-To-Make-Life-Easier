name: "Strawberry Cheesecake Dip For Fruits and Snacks"

description: "Strawberry Cheesecake Dip For Fruits and Snacks. This dip is creamy with just the right amount of strawberry, whip cream, and sugar. The cream cheese gives it that slight cheesy tangy flavor like cheesecake. Imagine dipping your favorite snack in cold, sweet fruity dip, and a plus of guilt free eating when you know it is healthier. So I present to you a good healthy skinny fruit dip that you can totally feel good about eating."
