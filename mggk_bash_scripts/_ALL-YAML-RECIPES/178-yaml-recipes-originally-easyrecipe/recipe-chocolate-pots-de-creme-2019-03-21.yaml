name: "Chocolate Pots De Creme"

description: "Chocolate Pots de Creme is a name for a classic and elegant French dessert which means 'The Pot Of Custard' or 'The Pot Of Cream'. The egg yolks make this recipe moist rich and creamy, and turn it into a finest and smoothest dessert that I could ever think of. This is almost like a chocolate pudding, but a thousand times better."
