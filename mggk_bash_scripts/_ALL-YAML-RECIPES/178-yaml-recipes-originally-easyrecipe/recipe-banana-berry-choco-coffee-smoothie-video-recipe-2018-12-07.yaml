description: "Banana-Berry Choco-Coffee Smoothie is just so simple yet so festive. And I must say it has got all the flavors of Christmas. It has the sweetness of banana, tang of berries (strawberry+raspberry). Distinct flavor of coffee, and the right amount of chocolate powder to shine that flavor."
