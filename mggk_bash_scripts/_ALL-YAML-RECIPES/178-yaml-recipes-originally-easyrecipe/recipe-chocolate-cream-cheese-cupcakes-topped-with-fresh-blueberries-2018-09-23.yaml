name: "Chocolate Cream Cheese Cupcakes Topped with Fresh Blueberries"

description: "Chocolate Cream Cheese Cupcakes Topped with Fresh Blueberries. These are delish! I added some extra frosting because I personally like my baked goodies with some extra sweetness. So a whip cream frosting it was, and finally I topped them with toasted marshmallow and sugar-coated fresh blueberries."
