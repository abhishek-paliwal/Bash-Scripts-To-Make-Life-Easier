description: "Tortilla Poha With Kiwi Peanut Salsa is an Indo Mexican inspired bowl. Tortilla Poha delicious dish made from leftover Roti, phulka or chapatis. This poha tastes wonderful by itself, but I love to enjoy it with a bit more of flavor punch. This extra flavor comes from Kiwi Peanut Salsa. This salsa is what completes this poha. It’s sweet, spicy and has just a nice crunch of peanut and flavor of fresh cilantro. This makes a perfect breakfast or brunch."
