name: "Summer Berry Salad With Salted Peanuts and Walnuts"

description: "Summer Berry Salad With Salted Peanuts and Walnuts would make a perfect lunch or an elegant brunch. And this is even perfect for takeaway lunches. Just add the dressing on before you eat it so that the lettuce stays nice and crisp.. This is a perfect dish for those days when we are really in a hurry. It’s filler yet light on the stomach."
