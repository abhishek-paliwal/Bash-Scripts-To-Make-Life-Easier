description: "Szechuan Spiced Carrot Fettuccine is such a perfect light meal, be it for lunch or dinner. This is the most beautiful, mouthwatering, spicy, flavorful, vegan and gluten free fettuccine. And it packs so much flavor. The carrots are slightly crunchy and they are best when paired nicely with this spicy sauce. It has Szechuan sauce, veggies, zesty tahini garlic paste, hot sauce for some spicy goodness and some tomato ketchup for tang and sweetness."
