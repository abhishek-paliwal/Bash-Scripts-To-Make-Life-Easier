name: "Vegan Coconut  Blueberry Ice-Cream"

description: "This Vegan Coconut Blueberry Ice Cream is so creamy and classic. And you don’t need an ice cream maker to create it. Blueberries are gently swirled into a coconut whip cream base, which creates a colorful dessert that tastes as delectable as the coconut and blueberries themselves. You would only need one scoop of this fruity dessert after an evening meal, and you can simply call it a day! Nothing can beat that refreshing feeling."
