Cinnamon and cardamom provide a subtle background flavor which works wonderfully with the tart and apricots. The topping of almond on pastry and on the top is what makes it more desirable. Some sprinkle of cinnamon sugar at the end. It can be eaten hot, warm or cold with a dollop of ice-cream or may be without the ice-cream."
