description: "With these No Bake Strawberry Cheesecake Bites, you don’t have to worry about finishing the whole cheesecake. But that doesn’t mean that I am saying we always have to stick with just one, or two, or three bites. But at least the option of eating less is there, right? Plus, they are no bake and they are perfectly bite sized. They also have just the right amount of strawberry cheesecake goodness in every single bite."
