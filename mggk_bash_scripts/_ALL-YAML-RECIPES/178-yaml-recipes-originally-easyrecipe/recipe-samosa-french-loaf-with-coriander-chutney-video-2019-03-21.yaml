description: "Do you want to know how it feels like when you have a combo of Samosa French loaf + Green Chutney? It’s simply heavenly. It’s basically like a samosa wrapped in french loaf and served with lush green chutney. Plus, the loaf has no onion and garlic. I promise it’s probably one of the best “samosas” you’ll eat. I mean, it has french loaf which is paired with some spicy potato peas stuffing — it is easy too. They are just AWESOME for weight watchers. They are not deep-fried. So a guilt-free treat too."
