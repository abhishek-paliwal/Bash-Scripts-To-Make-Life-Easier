description: "Corn Cream Cheese Flatbread with Orange Vinaigrette is a cheesy flatbread but different from pizza. The cream cheese is not baked like pizza, instead it is spread on flatbread along with parsley + basil pesto + honey + ground pepper + salt. Isn’t it making you drool already? It has all the goodness of cheese, fruits and veggies."
