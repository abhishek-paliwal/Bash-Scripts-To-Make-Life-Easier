description: "Spiced potato sandwiches are one of the most common and delicious Indian sandwiches. They are so quick and easy.  Spiced potato sandwiches aka aloo masala sandwiches are stuffed with spicy potato filling. These sandwiches are indeed very amazing, with so much flavor. Apply some butter on both pieces of bread slices. And then the potato filling, and a slice of cheese and lettuce and top with another bread."
