description: "This ridiculously creamy and delicious 4 - Ingredients Strawberry Cake Shake is the best milkshake ever! You will love all of the textures in this milkshake. There’s the creaminess of the ice cream, which is mixed with the soft cake. Fluffy whipped cream and silky chocolate sauce + caramel sauce to add more layers of flavor, and they are completely necessary."
