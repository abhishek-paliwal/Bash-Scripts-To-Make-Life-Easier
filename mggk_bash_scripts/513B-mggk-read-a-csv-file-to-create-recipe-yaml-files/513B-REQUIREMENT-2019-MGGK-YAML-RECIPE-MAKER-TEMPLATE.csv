3,"Marinated Cucumbers
","Quick and easy, marinated cucumbers don’t take much effort as most of the preparation happens while the dish sits in the fridge. If you’re tight on time, this would be the ideal side to bring to a gathering.",Anupama Paliwal,PT1H,PT10M,PT1H10M,Side,Asian,4,21,1 serving,"marinated cucumbers recipe, marinated cucumbers with dill, marinated cucumbers salad","!!Ingredients:
2 whole cucumbers
1 sprig of dill
¼ cup vinegar
¼ cup water
1 lime
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tbsp oil","!!Instructions:
This dish can be prepared the night before or an hour before, depending on how much time you have. All in all, the actual preparation takes about ten minutes. 
Begin by washing the cucumbers and slicing them thinly, or using a mandolin. Leave the skin on! It’s where all the nutrients are, and it won’t take away from the appeal. Place the cucumber in a shallow dish. 
In a measuring cup, combine the vinegar, water, and oil. Chop dill up or break by hand for larger pieces, and mix in with the liquid ingredients.
Sprinkle the cucumbers with salt and pepper. Pour the vinegar mixture evenly over the slices, using a fork to make sure every slice is distributed evenly and in contact with the liquid. 
Roll the lime against a hard surface to release the juices, cut in half, and squeeze over the dish. Cover the cucumbers with a lid or cling wrap and refrigerate, either overnight or for at least an hour. This dish can be served chilled or at room temp.

4,Buttermilk Biscuits,"Biscuits are popular in many fast food chains, but you probably didn’t know that they’re incredibly easy to make at home and take no longer than a half hour.",Anupama Paliwal,PT15M,PT18M,PT33M,Breakfast,British,8,88,1 serving,"buttermilk biscuits from scratch, buttermilk biscuits recipe, buttermilk biscuits all purpose flour, buttermilk biscuits best, buttermilk biscuits baking soda","!!Ingredients:
2 cups flour
Buttermilk (¾ cups milk plus 2tbs vinegar – this works with milk alternatives as well!)
6 tbsp butter, cold
¼ tbsp baking soda
1 tbsp baking powder
2 tsp sugar
Salt","!!Instructions:
If you’re making the buttermilk from scratch, combine the milk and vinegar in a measuring cup and let chill in the refrigerator.
Preheat the oven to 450 and line a baking sheet. In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.
You can cube butter and cut it in, but we’ve found a simpler way to incorporate the frustrating ingredient: grate it. As long as the butter is cold, you can easily grate it using a cheese grater. Add the butter into the flour and use your hands to mix the two, crumbling the flour and butter between your hands until it reaches a fine, pea-sized consistency. 
Pour almost all of the buttermilk into the mixture (leave at least a few tablespoons) and beat it on low until everything is incorporated but not over-mixed. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and carefully fold it over repeatedly a few times. 
Making sure the surface is floured just enough that the dough won’t stick, flatten it by hand or with a roller to about ½ inch thickness. Cut out circles using a cookie cutter or by cutting with a knife around an upturned glass to guide you.
After you place the biscuits on the baking sheet, brush the tops of each one lightly with the remaining buttermilk. If you’d like to add a bit of sweetness, drizzle honey on top.
Bake at 450 for about 15-18 minutes, until golden brown on top.
